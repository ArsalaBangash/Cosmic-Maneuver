# Cosmic-Maneuver
Any Confusion Here Studios presents a thrilling accelerometer based space experience. 

Stay alive by maneuvering your alien spaceship past the oncoming asteroids. Collect coins, use bombs, and obtain boosts or nerfs through mystery boxes to maximize your score and stay alive longer!

Choose from three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium and Hard. Depending on the difficulty, the number of initial bombs, the frequency of added asteroids, and the increase in their speeds. Try setting unique high scores for each difficulty setting, as each one provides a different challenge.

We hope you enjoy playing Cosmic Maneuver as much as we enjoyed the development journey. We hope you recommend this app to your friends and rate it five stars on the Play Store!
